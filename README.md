Glenn Sutherland's miscellaneous code

These are wrapper functions for managing input/output using to the ECCC_Caribou Project and supporting modules. 
Specifically, they generalize the library(openxlsx) functions read.xlsx() and write.xlsx() to handle named lists.
The functions are used by multiple modules so are placed here.
